A package from the [Umbraco Community Sustainability Team](https://umbraco.com/blog/meet-the-new-community-sustainability-team/) which helps developers and editors see and improve the carbon impact of their websites.

In the Backoffice, there is a Content App to see page weight and carbon emissions, which is then converted to a carbon rating for individual pages.

## Installation

Add the package to an existing Umbraco website (v10.4+) from nuget:

`dotnet add package Umbraco.Community.Sustainability`

Once added, a new Content App will be available alongside your Umbraco pages allowing you to trigger a sustainability report.

## Contributing

Contributions to this package are most welcome! Please read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get involved.

Here are some things for our roadmap:

- A visual review of the content app (particularly with v14/Belissima in mind)
- Dashboard
- Health checks
- Content and media warnings
- Configuration options
- Improved accuracy of reporting
