A community package from the [Umbraco Community Sustainability Team](https://umbraco.com/blog/meet-the-new-community-sustainability-team/) which helps developers and editors see and improve the carbon impact of their websites.

In the Backoffice, there is a Content App to see page weight and carbon emissions, which is then converted to a carbon rating for individual pages.

## Installation

Add the package to an existing Umbraco website (v10.4+) from nuget:

`dotnet add package Umbraco.Community.Sustainability`

Once added, a new Content App will be available alongside your Umbraco pages allowing you to trigger a sustainability report.
