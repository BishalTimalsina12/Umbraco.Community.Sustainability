A community package from the [Umbraco sustainability team](https://umbraco.com/blog/meet-the-new-community-sustainability-team/), which helps developers and editors see and improve the carbon impact of their websites.

In the backoffice, there is a content app to see page weight and carbon emissions, which is then converted to a carbon rating for individual pages.

<!--
Including screenshots is a really good idea! 

If you put images into /docs/screenshots, then you would reference them in this readme as, for example:

<img alt="..." src="https://github.com/rickbutterfield/Umbraco.Community.Sustainability/blob/develop/docs/screenshots/screenshot.png">
-->

## Installation

Add the package to an existing Umbraco website (v10.4+) from nuget:

`dotnet add package Umbraco.Community.Sustainability`

Once added, a new content app will be available alongside your Umbraco pages allowing you to trigger a sustainability report.
